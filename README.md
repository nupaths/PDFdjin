# My First Commit

This is a my first commit readme file for our Github my-first-repo. We're learning Markdown.
This repository shares the completed code for a list of forms.

My Challenge: Utilize the knowledge I have gained from the desk-top tutorial series to build a website for each form.

Create fields on a pdf file.
Create dynamic forms that allow client to fill out a field of a form and (download) as a pdf file.

#Uses# With this simple web application one can provide digital documents to be filled through a web browser via a form that is generated dynamically. #Could be part of a larger Document Management System.


Directions:
    - There are images of the 4 web pages I need to build in the examples folder and are used as references for what I build.

    - I've named my HTML files: field_markup.html and index_of_formfiller.html

    - There is minimal CSS already available: snackbar.css, style.css, and styles_formfiller. I need to link that file to the HTML files.

    - All images are provided in the images folder.
